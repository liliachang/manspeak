Weinstein,Harvey,10/5/17,Producer and co-founder of the Weinstein Company,"Raping three women. Sexual assault and harassment of dozens of others Ñ including masturbating, exposing himself and unwelcome touching.","I came of age in the 60's and 70's, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then. I have since learned it's not an excuse, in the office - or out of it. To anyone. I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person and my interactions with the people I work with have changed. I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I'm trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go. That is my commitment. My journey now will be to learn about myself and conquer my demons. Over the last year I've asked Lisa Bloom to tutor me and she's put together a team of people. I've brought on therapists and I plan to take a leave of absence from my company and to deal with this issue head on. I so respect all women and regret what happened. I hope that my actions will speak louder than words and that one day we will all be able to earn their trust and sit down together with Lisa to learn more. Jay Z wrote in 4:44 ""I'm not the man I thought I was and I better be that man for my children."" The same is true for me. I want a second chance in the community but I know I've got work to do to earn it. I have goals that are now priorities. Trust me, this isn't an overnight process. I've been trying to do this for 10 years and this is a wake-up call. I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt and I plan to do right by all of them. I am going to need a place to channel that anger so I've decided that I'm going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party. I'm going to do it at the same place I had my Bar Mitzvah. I'm making a movie about our President, perhaps we can make it a joint retirement party. One year ago, I began organizing a $5 million foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC. While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year. It will be named after my mom and I won't disappoint her. ",Fired
Savino,Chris,10/17/17,"Creator and showrunner of ""The Loud House""","Sexual harassment, including unwanted sexual advances, of as may as 12 women.","I am deeply sorry and ashamed. Although it was never my intention, I now understand that the impact of my actions and communications created an unacceptable environment. At every stage of my career, I have sought to uplift my colleagues and cultivate a culture of respect. In this objective, I have failed. I should have known better, I should have acted better, and this has been a difficult but valuable lesson. I have nothing but the deepest respect for the bravery of the women who have spoken out, trying to create an environment in which they can thrive to their fullest potential.",Fired
Scoble,Robert,10/19/17,Tech blogger and co-founder of the Transformation Group,Sexual assault of at least two women.,"In the past week several news outlets reported that I had committed numerous sexual indiscretions against numerous women. I am sorry that so many women feel wronged by me, but I hope to set at least some of the record straight. I apologize for the delay in the response, the allegations are quite serious, and many are from a number of years ago, and before responding I needed to consult with a lawyer, witnesses, my wife and others.

I have rejected my lawyer's advice to not make a statement and in a spirit of healing I would like to address the issue head on with open and honest dialogue.

Any response creates potential liability, and lawyers optimize for reducing exposure so they advise against responding. But, for the past 20 years I have made my living shining light on people, products, and issues. I am unwilling to not be that person just because people have made allegations against me. This advice from attorneys is one reason why as a community we can't properly discuss the issues hitting our industry. When companies and individuals can't speak out for risk that it opens them to a lawsuit it limits the responsible dialogue we can have.

TechCrunch and Business Insider ÒbrokeÓ the news, but in a move inconceivable to me, they didn't do any diligence to verify the accusations made against me. I recognize that these two organizations are basically just Gossip Blogs at this point, and that ÒIf it bleeds it leadsÓ is a way to generate click bait, but I expected more of them.

Even the most rudimentary fact check by news outlets would have caught a few obvious things. If I were guilty of all the things said about me I would still not be in a position to have sexually harassed anyone. I don't have employees, I don't cut checks for investment. None of the women who came forward were ever in a position where I could make or break their careers. Sexual Harassment requires that I have such power. That is not to say that the allegations aren't serious. I take them very seriously, but it is to say that, TechCrunch, Business Insider and others, in their rush to publish ClickBait were so obviously flawed that it is clear they no longer care about the truth or doing actual journalism.

Then there is the actual truth of the allegations. Each of the women who have come forward used grains of truth to sell false narrative. Perhaps because they felt peer pressure to join the #MeToo bandwagon, perhaps because they felt slighted for other reasons. I won't speculate on their motives.

Sarah Seitz and I had an online affair. I am a married man. She knew this, and didn't care. During the more than a year that we exchanged very sexual conversation, when things never advanced beyond mere conversation, and when it became apparent that I didn't have the power to advance her career any more than the introductions I had already made she felt scorned and attempted to blackmail me by threatening to tell my wife, Maryam, which she did shortly thereafter. I deeply wronged my wife by engaging in this behavior. I hurt my family. And to some extent my online affair did take advantage of Seitz; I hate to be the person who outs Seitz for her own abuse, but that was what we connected over primarily. We talked a great deal about how each of us dealt with abuse and how it impacted our sex lives.

In talking with friends I am not the only person Seitz has felt the need to shame online when she felt jilted. Others have experienced being called out when they didn't meet up when Seitz was traveling or when they didn't want to convert online flirtations to a real world interaction. There are a great many things in Seitz's conversations I would prefer never be public, not because I did wrong by Seitz, but because where I have said I don't really care about privacy online, I don't feel that exposing my sexual fantasies or desires online as a text based Òsex tapeÓ is something anyone needs to see.

Another of the women who accused me, Sarah Kunst, is an African-American female entrepreneur. Kunst categorized a comment I made as racist at a conference we both attended. She took my asking ÒWhy are you hereÓ to be a question of Òwhy are you deserving of being here.Ó That was not my intention at all. I tried to talk her down from this, but failed. More than an hour later, still mad, and drunk, she mistook another attendee for me and told him off loudly in front of others, then went on to tell off my wife Maryam. Anyone who knows Maryam, knows that the idea that she would verbally harass anyone is ludicrous, but Business Insider reports that.

I appreciate that being an African-American female entrepreneur is hard. I also understand that many in the industry are skeptical or dismissive when they interact with someone who breaks two stereotypes of entrepreneurs [not being white or male]. Perhaps my innocent question should have been phrased as ÒWhat is your goal for this conference,Ó but it wasn't. At the conference I apologized for that, and I apologize again, that I could have either had more build up to the question, or phrased it better. But to categorize the action as ÒVerbal AssaultÓ or to extend such allegations to my wife is unfair.

Michelle Greer, who I worked with at Rackspace, was never in a reporting structure beneath me, and while we engaged in flirtations, the limits of the impropriety was that I was flirting with someone when I was married. As part of the terms of my layoff from Rackspace I am required to not say anything disparaging against Rackspace, and I am seeking answers from them about what I can and cannot publicly say about this alleged incident. But I can say I was not ever fired from Rackspace, I was laid off at a time when many other employees were also laid off, and received severance for several months afterwards. Others have come forward and said Michelle Greer was let go from Rackspace for reasons unrelated to any interactions she and I had. We never had any interactions in a private situation and while that doesn't mean that it is impossible for inappropriate behavior to occur, it demonstrates that at the time neither of us was ashamed of our behavior. If Rackspace did end Greer's employment because of these interactions it was not at my request.

Quinn Norton, by her own account, physically accosted me. She didn't call for conference security, she didn't know the name of the woman I was making out with to know if we were engaged in a consensual activity. In her account of the night, she took it upon herself to decide in advance that she was going to warn me she was dangerous, and then physically attack me without knowing the story of my earlier makeout. If two drunk married people want to make out on the beach it may be a bad decision, (It was a bad decision on my part) but it was our bad decision to make. While it is admirable that Quinn wanted to defend the honor of another woman and the sanctity of marriage, perhaps she should have done so using the resources of the conference, or at a minimum in a manner that didn't lead to her assaulting me. Quinn, who is a reporter, didn't report this story for years, and she didn't run the story in her capacity as a reporter, she chose social media with no bar for truth, and requirement that her story pass a fact check. Quinn who purports to be a champion against sexism was strangely silent. She sat on her allegations for more than 5 years. Her recall of the night seems unlikely due to her great detail including quotes, but without the names of any of the participants but myself. Most telling however is that she makes it clear that her assault of me was premeditated. She planned to separate me from the woman I was making out with, she planned to scare me, and she planned to use her martial arts training to injure me.

I am deeply apologetic that I have wronged my wife. I apologize to women in general that I could have been a better man and husband. Every act of infidelity, every time I have watched an adult video online, every time I have made an inappropriate joke, or laughed at one, I have wronged women.

I have tried to be a champion for all entrepreneurs equally. I believe I have given as much opportunity to women, and minorities as to other groups. I tend to gravitate towards cool tech and who has made that tech doesn't really matter to me. I haven't always had editorial control, many times others chose who I interviewed, or it was dictated by who was at a given conference, but I can't recall a time when I turned anyone down who had a worthy product, or made for an interesting conversation. If anything I have been criticized for often lending my audience to products that weren't innovative enough, or that because I didn't edit down the video the subject was not meaty enough. But whenever possible I shared my platform with anyone who wanted it with no regard for their background, skin color, orientation, or gender.

I have been trying to internalize that as someone who has been abused that I have behaviors that are part of my survival tactics and I work to change those behaviors. I am attempting to recover from my addictions, but with regard to the immediate allegations from the article the inaccuracies make it hard to be apologetic. Every one of these women have had hardships, and I don't envy any of their positions in life, but that doesn't justify their malice towards me, my wife, and family and friends who have supported me.

Others have sought to distance themselves from me, and I understand that. Shel Israel and I have worked on a great many projects together, and when he approached me to ask that we go our separate ways I decided I didn't want to work with anyone who wouldn't stand by me. I did not express that the allegations against me were ÒMostly TrueÓ and I did not express that I would be taking off the rest of the year. As I said at the start of this post, there are grains of truth, and I told Shel that the statements were true enough that I would need to address them. I also said that I would need to take time to address the allegations and that I didn't know if that meant a month or a year, I did not specify a time.

I did express to several people that until I knew how time consuming answering allegations might be, and if there were going to be any legal actions I might have to defend against that I would be occupied until at least the end of the month.

Many have been asking how I, and my family, are doing personally. My answer has been Òbetter than yesterdayÓ and while that is true, at least since these allegations came forth, truth is I am in a rebuilding process that will lead to much better relationships with everyone. I need time to deal with myself and the harm I've caused others, starting with the harm I've caused to my marriage, my sons, and to Maryam, in particular. After a period of time we'll have more conversations about that, but Maryam and I are working through a bunch of very tough things and I'm working hard on becoming a better human being.

As part of working on myself and repairing the relationships with my family, and unrelated to the recent events, I have been working to launch a new business, and a new career. Social Media has been my life for nearly 20 years, but it encourages a lifestyle that is not healthy for me or my family. I am transitioning into a job where I can work from home much more, and travel much less. This will give me more time to spend with my wife and kids. You can learn a bit about this here: http://lightpitch.launchrock.com/

I have avoided naming people who weren't named in the press so far, but there is an acknowledgment of appreciation I want to make. In the early stages of this hitting, Jessica Guynn of USAToday called for comment, and when I mentioned that I appreciated her doing a call to fact check things, unlike many other journalists who had already run stories, she said, ÒWell, these days there's a low bar [for fact checking].Ó  

Part of my fascination with social media over the years has been in how it gives a voice to anyone who wants or needs it. The problem is that while it extends great power to those who use it responsibly, it also extends great power to those who want to use it to harm others.

As a tech journalist I've given the others a chance to speak and provided them a forum for their message. I have helped amplify the message of others when I felt it appropriate to do so, but I have been careful about promoting damning posts without checking their validity. TechCrunch and Business Insider failed in this regard. They set out to profit from the harm to me without regard for the truthiness of the story.

Another part of my love of social media has been that it creates dialog. I welcome dialog about the state of the industry, how we can make things better for people of all backgrounds, and how we can have responsible conversations in a world where a single tweet could result in nuclear war.

I have said many times in the past I have been working to be a better person, and overcome my addictions, and repair the relationship with my family. I am blessed to have a wife who has continued to love me through adversity, and kids who care so much about me. Many friends have supported me in this both before and after these most recent allegations. I thank them for their support. It means a great deal that so many have stood by me when it would be easier to distance themselves.",Resigned
Besh,John,10/21/17,Chief executive of the Besh Restaurant Group,Sexual harassment.,"Two years ago, I deeply hurt those I love by thoughtlessly engaging in a consensual relationship with one member of my team. Since then I have been seeking to rebuild my marriage and come to terms with my reckless actions given the profound love I have for my wife, my boys and my Catholic faith. I also regret any harm this may have caused to my second family at the restaurant group, and sincerely apologize to anyone past and present who has worked for me who found my behavior as unacceptable as I do. I alone am entirely responsible for my moral failings. This is not the way the head of a company like ours should have acted, let alone a husband and father.

Toback,James,10/22/17,Director and writer,Sexual harassment and misconduct toward women," Lemme be really clear about this. I don't want to get a pat on the back, but I've struggled seriously to make movies with very little money, that I write, that I direct, that mean my life to me. The idea that I would offer a part to anyone for any other reason than that he or she was gonna be the best of anyone I could find is so disgusting to me. And anyone who says it is a lying cocksucker or cunt or both. Can I be any clearer than that? Anyone who says that, I just want to spit in his or her fucking face. I'm sitting here with Sienna Miller. By the way, no one who's ever worked with me would ever say anything like that. No one. But I've just finished a movie with Sienna, which you should see, and help to get out there, called The Private Life of a Modern Woman. But here, she's sitting right here, so just say hello to her. No, seriously, I find it offensive and insulting and disgusting, that peopleÉ Because it's the opposite of the way I work. I don't give my best friends parts unless they deserve them. Ever. OK, that is a total lie. I never heard of the person before. And then who was the other one? First of all, that description wouldn't fit anyone, but I never heard that name before in my life. And believe me, I would remember it, because it's a very unusual name. You know, I mean, what happensÉ this is just too stupid. I mean, these are people I don't know, and it's things I never would have done. And it's just not worth talking about. It's idiotic. My question to you is, do you want to be a writer? Do you have any sense of yourself as a serious person? Because this stuff should be beneath anybody. No, they hear each other. And they gang up. There was an article years and years ago with a bunch of anonymous people. People read thingsÉ it's all, you know, me too, me too, me too, me too, me too. Anyway, it's too stupid to waste time on. It really is. It doesn't have anything to do with my life in any way. It never has. I work seriously with complete integrity. I never, never, never have offered a part to anyone who didn't deserve it, and I've never not delivered when I do offer a part. My word is better than a contract. Anything like that is nauseating and disgusting. And I would never say anything like 'I'll get you a film role.' It's too stupid to dignify. It's pathetic lies. It's just too fucking embarrassing and idiotic. And if I were you, I wouldn't go repeating it, unless you really knew it were true, because it isn't. So that's all I have to say. This is not worth wasting another second on.

Halperin,Mark,10/26/17,"NBC News, MSNBC contributor.",Sexual harassment of at least five women.,"I am profoundly sorry for the pain and anguish I have caused by my past actions. I apologize sincerely to the women I mistreated. The world is now publicly acknowledging what so many women have long known: Men harm women in the workplace. That new awareness is, of course, a positive development. For a long time at ABC News, I was part of the problem. I acknowledge that, and I deeply regret it. As I said earlier in the week, my behavior was wrong. It caused fear and anxiety for women who were only seeking to do their jobs. In recent days I have closely read the accounts of women with whom I worked at ABC News. I have not read these accounts looking for discrepancies or inconsistencies. Instead, in almost every case, I have recognized conduct for which I feel profound guilt and responsibility, some involving junior ABC News personnel and women just starting out in the news business. Many of the accounts conveyed by journalists working on stories about me or that I have read after publication have not been particularly detailed (and many were anonymous) making it difficult for me to address certain specifics. But make no mistake: I fully acknowledge and apologize for conduct that was often aggressive and crude. Towards the end of my time at ABC News, I recognized I had a problem. No one had sued me, no one had filed a human resources complaint against me, no colleague had confronted me. But I didn't need a call from HR to know that I was a selfish, immature person, who was behaving in a manner that had to stop. For several years around my departure from ABC News, I had weekly counseling sessions to work on understanding the personal issues and attitudes that caused me to behave in such an inappropriate manner. Those who have worked with me in the past decade know that my conduct in subsequent jobs at TIME, Bloomberg, NBC News, and Showtime has not been what it was at ABC. i did not engage in improper behavior with colleagues or subordinates. If you spoke to my co-workers in those four places (men and women alike), I am confident you would find that I had a very different reputation than I had at ABC News because I had conducted myself in a very different manner. Some of the allegations that have been made against me are not true. But I realize that is a small point in the scheme of things. Again, I bear responsibility for my outrageous conduct at ABC News. I hope that not only will women going forward be more confident in speaking up, but also that we as an industry and society can create an atmosphere that no longer tolerates this kind of behavior. I know I can never do enough to make up for the harm I caused. I will be spending time with my family and friends, as I work to make amends and contributions both large and small. ",Dismissed.

Hoover,Jeff,11/1/17,Kentucky speaker of the House,Sexual harassment and inappropriate text messages. ,"To say that the past few weeks, and especially the past four days, have been trying and difficult would be an understatement. With prayer, support from my family and friends, and hundreds of people, we have endured. I want to thank so many Kentuckians who have reached out to me and my family during this time. The decision today is what is best for Kentucky, what is best for the House of Representatives. For 21 years, the folks in Russell, Clinton, Cumberland, and Pulaski counties have given me the honor and privilege to serve and represent them here in Frankfort. I have served them and the citizens of this state to the very best of my ability. I have tried to develop and maintain a sense of fairness, honesty, and integrity in all my dealings and actions in Frankfort. I have tried, since January, as Speaker of the House, to change the tone of how things were done in Frankfort, to show that folks from both parties, majority and minority, should be engaged in the process and could work together to solve issues and make the Kentucky we all love a better place. I am proud of the work we have done, and the progress we have made. Now we face a difficult time. A few weeks ago, on October 17th, I received a letter from an attorney on behalf of his client making allegations, let me repeat, allegations, against me and others for sexual harassment. The letter was not a demand letter in the sense of demanding a sum of money Ð it requested that we negotiate a resolution instead of litigating the allegations. I immediately contacted and sought the advice of counsel. After discussing the matter with counsel on October 18th, I informed the other individuals named in the allegations. On October 20th, we met with counsel to discuss the allegations. In the meantime, our counsel and the complainant's attorney spoke about setting up a formal mediation with a mediator selected, and paid, by both sides in an effort to resolve the dispute and in a manner requested by the complainant's attorney. By mutual agreement, this meeting was held five days later, just eight days after the letter was received, and as was requested by the complainant. At that mediation, an agreement was reached between all parties and all counsel to resolve the issue. None of the parties against whom the allegations were made admitted any wrongdoing. In fact, all of those individuals, including myself, absolutely and expressly denied any sexual harassment had taken place. The parties agreed that the mediation and resolution should remain confidential, which was important to both sides in the effort to move forward in the employment relationship. I did make mistakes in that I engaged in inappropriate text messages. I engaged in banter that was consensual, but yet was wrong on my part, and, for that, I am truly support. I have asked for and received forgiveness from God, my wife, Karyn, and my family has forgiven me and I have their unwavering support. Today, I ask the people of this Commonwealth to forgive me for my actions. I am truly sorry and ask for your forgiveness. But, as inappropriate as those text messages were, I want to reiterate at no time did I engage in unwelcome or unwanted conduct of any kind, and at no time were there ever any sexual relations of any kind. There has never been a culture of sexual harassment, as some opportunists would wrongly claim for their personal political gain. I can move forward in my life thanks to friends and family who, I hope, know the real Jeff Hoover, and know this was a mistake. I have fallen short. I am a sinner.

The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions. And I've tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I'm aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position. I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn't want to hear it. I didn't think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it. There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am. Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with. I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work.

The hardest regret to live with is what you've done to hurt someone else. And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them. I'd be remiss to exclude the hurt that I've brought on people who I work with and have worked with who's professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You, Daddy. I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused. I've brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie. and every other entity that has bet on me through the years. I've brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.

I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen. Thank you for reading.",FX and other media companies cut ties. Movie release and comedy special were canceled. 
Kresiberg,Andrew,11/10/17,Producer,Sexual harassment of more than a dozen people.,"have made comments on women's appearances and clothes in my capacity as an executive producer, but they were not sexualized. Like many people, I have given someone a non-sexual hug or kiss on the cheek. I have proudly mentored both male and female colleagues for many years. But never in what I believe to be an unwanted way and certainly never in a sexual way. ",Suspended fro Warner Bros. TV Group.
Franken,Al,11/16/17,U.S. Senator,"Sexual harassment of two women, including forcibly kissing and groping.","The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worke for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women. There's more I want to say, but the first and most important thing -- and if it's the only thing you care to hear, that's fine -- is: I'm sorry. I respect women. I don't respect men who don't. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doub tthat makes me feel ashamed. But I want to say something else, too. Over the last few months, all of us -- including and especially men who respect women -- have been forced to take a good, hard look at our own actions and think (perhaps, shamefully, for the first time) about how those actions have affectd women. For instance, that picture. I don't know what was in my head when i took that picture, and it doesn't matter. There's no excuse. I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself. It isn't funny. It's completely inappropriate. It's obvious how Leeann would feel violated by that picture. And, what's more, I can see how millions of other women would feel violated by it -- women who have had similar experiences in their own lives, women who fear having those experiences, women who look up to me, women who have acounted on me. Coming from the world of comedy, I've told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive. But the intentions behind my actions aren't the point at all. It's the impact thes jokes had on others that matters. And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to come to terms with that. While I don't remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does, I understand why we need to listen to and believe women's experiences. I am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken, and I will gladly cooperate. And the truth is. what people thik of me in light of this is far less important than what people think of women who continue to come forwar to tell their stories. They deserve to be heard, and blieved. And they deserve to know that I am their ally and supporter. I have let them down and am committed to making it up to them.",Under investigation.
Thrush,Glenn,11/20/17,Reporter at The New York Times,"Sexually inappropriate behavior toward at least four women, including groping and unwanted kissing.","I apologize to any woman who felt uncomfortable in my presence, and for any situation where I behaved inappropriately. Any behavior that makes a woman feel disrespected or uncomfortable is unacceptable.",Suspended pending an investigation by The New York Times.
Rose,Charlie,11/20/17,Television host,"Sexual harassment of at least eight women, including groping and lewd phone calls.","In my 45 years of journalism, I have prided myself on being an advocate for the careers of the women with whom I have worked. Nevertheless, in the past few days, claims have been made about my behavior toward some former female colleagues. It is essential that these women know I hear them and that I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior. I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, tohugh I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken. I have learned a great deal as a result of these events, and I hope others will too. All of us, including me, are coming to a newer and deeper recognition of the pain caused by conduct in the past, and have come to a profound new respect for women and their lives. ","Fired by CBS. Bloomberg and PBS canceled distribution of his interview show, ÒCharlie Rose.Ó"
Lasseter,John,11/21/17,Head of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation,"Sexual harassment, including grabbing, unwanted kissing and making comments about physical attributes.","I have always wanted our animation studios to be places where creators can explore their vision with the support and collaboration of other gifted animators and storytellers. This kind of creative culture takes constant vigilance to maintain. It's built on trust and respect, and it becomes fragile if any members of the team don't feel valued. As a leader, it's my responsibility to ensure that doesn't happen; and I now believe I have been falling short in this regard.

I've recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me. It's never easy to face your missteps, but it's the only way to learn from them. As a result, I've been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It's been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespected or uncomfortable. That was never my intent. Collectively, you mean the world to me, and I deeply apologize if I have let you down. I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form. No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.

In my conversations with Disney, we are united in our commitment to always treat any concerns you have with the seriousness they deserve, and to address them in an appropriate manner. We also share a desire to reinforce the vibrant, respectful culture that has been the foundation of our studios' success since the beginning. And we agree the first step in that direction is for me to take some time away to reflect on how to move forward from here. As hard as it is for me to step away from a job I am so passionate about and a team I hold in the highest regard, not just as artists but as people, I know it's the best thing for all of us right now. My hope is that a six-month sabbatical will give me the opportunity to start taking better care of myself, to recharge and be inspired, and ultimately return with the insight and perspective I need to be the leader you deserve.

I'm immensely proud of this team, and I know you will continue to wow the world in my absence. I wish you all a wonderful holiday season and look forward to working together again in the new year.",Stepping away for Òa six-month sabbaticalÓ after Òmissteps.Ó
Conyers,John,11/21/17,U.S. House Representative,Multiple allegations of sexual harassment from former staffers.,"I have long been and continue to be a fierce advocate for equality in the workplace and I fully support the rights of employees who believe they have been harassed or discriminated against to assert claims against their employers. That said, it is important to recognize that the mere making of an allegation does not mean it is true. The process must be fair to both the employee and the accused. The current media environment is bringing a much-needed focus to the important issue of preventing harassment in workplaces across the country. However, equally important to keep in mind in this particular moment is the principle of due process and that those accused of wrongdoing are presumed innocent unless and until an investigation establishes otherwise. In our country, we strive to honor this fundamental principle that all are entitled to due process. In this case, I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me, and continue to do so. My office resolved the allegations Ð with an express denial of liability Ð in order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation. That should not be lost in the narrative. The resolution was not for millions of dollars, but rather for an amount that equated to a reasonable severance payment. There are statutory requirements of confidentiality that apply to both the employee and me regarding this matter. To the extent the House determines to look further at these issues, I will fully cooperate with an investigation.",Under investigation.
Keillor,Garrison,11/30/17,Radio host on Minessota Public Radio,,"I'm doing fine. Getting fired is a real distinction in broadcasting and I've waited fifty years for the honor. All of my heroes got fired. I only wish it could've been for something more heroic. I put my hand on a woman's bare back. I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later and she replied that she had forgiven me and not to think about it. We were friends. We continued to be friendly right up until her lawyer called. Anyone who ever was around my show can tell you that I was the least physically affection person in the building. Actors hug, musicians hug, people were embracing every Saturday night left and right, and I stood off in the corner like a stone statue. If I had a dollar for every woman who asked to take a selfie with me and who slipped an arm around me and let it drift down below the beltline, I'd have at least a hundred dollars. So this is poetic irony of a high order. But I'm just fine. I had a good long run and am grateful for it and for everything else.""",Fired.
Lauer,Matt,11/30/17,NBC News anchor,Sexual harrassment of at least 11 coworkers.,"There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC. Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly. Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I'm committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full time job. The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It's been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by the people I love. I thank them for their patience and grace.",Fired.
